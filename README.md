Medium's like reading time estimation for Elixir.
ReadingTime helps you estimate how long a text will take to read.

This based on [reading-time](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time) for JavaScript.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `reading_time` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:reading_time, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

The docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/reading_time](https://hexdocs.pm/reading_time).
